                    <p>In the conducted experiment, the mangrove population and soil
                        samples were sourced from the Qi'ao-Dangan Island Nature Reserve
                        located in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province (longitude: 113.635706°,
                        latitude: 22.414662°), and an observation station with tidal and
                        other hydrological data was established near this location.
                        Consequently, the proposed model takes this specific location as a
                        representative case and conduct a harmonic analysis of tidals, and
                        find the solution of the amplitude and the tidal epoch of each
                        tidal constituent.</p>
